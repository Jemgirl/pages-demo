# Welcome & Expectations<a name="welcome"></a>

Welcome to the Austin Community College Software Development Bootcamp.

We are ***really*** glad to begin this journey with you!

## Virtual Classroom Expectations

1. Turn your webcams on
   - Similar to sitting in a in-person class
   - Unless you have a techical issue, cameras **`MUST`** be on when attending virtually
1. Ask questions
   - Interactions are the best way to learn ‚Üê **`SERIOUSLY`**
1. Be vulnerable
   - It is ok to make mistakes while coding.
   - It is completely ok to ask newbie questions. It's why we all are here.
1. Screen sharing
   - Be prepared to have to share your screen at any time.
   - Zoom on the same computer that you are working on.

Some things you will need ...

1. **GitHub.com**: Here you will find all the learning materials, goals, exercises and other documents. Also, you will save your projects of the bootcamp. If you do not already have a github account, please create one. Then slack message a TA your **`github username`**

1. **Access to Github Class Repository**: If you have already done it, and shared your `github username` give it a few hours and check to see if you can view the ACCSoftwareBootcamp group within https://github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp. You must be logged into github.com

## Suggested Time Allocation

Generally, your time will be split 70/30, as follows:

Plan to spend 70% of your time on self-learning. Why?

1. Work when you are most productive
1. Slow down when needed
1. Ask for 1-on-1 help from instructors / mentors via Zoom screenshare

30% of your time in classroom:

1. Lectures to round out what you didn't learn on your own
1. Demos so you can view how others do it, and ask questions
1. 1-on-1 help before, during or after class
1. Class Projects
1. Guest Speakers

Spend ~35% of overall time on your chosen method of learning. How?

1. Watch or read the topics.
1. Ask questions on Slack (#general channel) if you don't understand.
1. Try the code demonstrated in class on your own.

Spend ~35% working on assigned homework. How?

1. Assigned homework starts easy and progressively get more difficult.
1. Ask for bonus homework if you are done early.
1. Show your code if you need help from instructors.

- We recommend 20+ hours / week for studying at home.

## Tips for Success

Some questions based on past students experience

1. If I miss a class, what can I do?
   - Recordings of class proceedings are posted to the #recording channel on slack. Utilize these recordings if you miss a class. However, do not rely soley on them for learning. If possible try not to miss any classes.

1. What if I wish to cherry-pick the topics I wish to learn?
   
   - This can and will lead to confusion as you learn. It is best to follow along with lectures, homeworks, exercises in order to grasp a better understanding of the material.

1. When should you plan to join the virtual classroom?

   We generally use the same access links for each class
   Log on 15 to 20 mins early
   - This will allow you to settle into the mood to learn
   - Give opportunity to discuss with Instructors/Mentors
   - Ask questions to your fellow students
   - Be there every class!!!  A missed class is very hard to cover on your own. It generally takes twice as long.

   Anything worthy of doing is harder and takes longer than you imagined. Programming is the same Do not give up too early.

1. What if you don't like the bootcamp process?
   
   Trying new things can be tough, but we believe sticking with the process will benefit you in the long run.

1. What to do if you're not learning?
  
   Reach out to fellow students and create study groups, and or contact an Instructor for additional assistance.

1. Should I pick up other languages, e.g. Python, PHP or Java?
  
   Instead of learning other languages now, focus on learning what is taught in the bootcamp. Most companies out there would rather see a potential candidate who understands the fundamentals of one langauge than someone who understands a little of every langauge.

1. What if I have any questions?

   Remember, asking for help is NOT a sign of weakness. It is a VITAL process of learning:
   
   Timebox the problem, e.g. 30 min, 60 min etc.
   
   Walk away - do something different -> walk the dog, mow the yard, something unrelated to your problem

   Go back to work on your problem, with a time limit

   ASK for help - we will discuss in more depth later

1. Should I take notes?
   
   Notes are an essential part of studying and keeping track of the vast material we will be going over then next 6 months.

   Take notes that make sense to you. Make it easier for yourself.

   A lot of information with be given to you, so notes will play a crucial part for your success.

   Notes need to be pointers to your memory, not a transcription of everything we cover. You will have access to all the materials.

1. What type of study habits work the best?

   If you haven't already, make sure you have access to a organized study environment.
    - an office
    - your room
    - library
    - wherever works well for you.

   Study when its convenient for you, in the day or at night.

   Reach out to fellow students for help first before coming to the Instructors/Mentors. You and other students might run into the same issues. So why not reach out to one another as a resource to study with and from?

## Logistics

  1. How do the class meetings work?

     Our classes are 3 to 4 hours long:

     - ~60-75 min lectures / demo
     - Breaks as announced (5 to 15 minutes)
     - Go over goals/readings **`BEFORE`** class
     - Lectures are meant to reinforce concepts NOT necessarily introduce them

  1. Where do I submit my work?
  
     We will invite you to a personal private repository. Once invited, it will be visible at https://github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp.

     This is where you will create your repo and save all of your bootcamp work

     After bootcamp, you may "fork" your repo to your own private repo outside of ACCSoftwareBootcamp group.

  1. Where do I find my study materials?

     Learning materials will come from GitHub:

   <img src="./assets/welcome2.png" style="margin-left: 10%;" width="80%">

   - https://github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Oct_2023
   - Here you can view all the instructor assigned learning materials and projects
   - It will be Read only
   - Check this often
   - Update notices for this repo are sent via Slack.

   <img src="./assets/welcome3.png" style="margin-left: 10%;" width="80%">

   - Folders - Topic module name, Each folder has all the materials that are needed

   - *goals.md* - This is the start of your learning for each week. It lists what you need to do on your own. There is one for each major topic, starting Week 1 thru Week 16

## Expectations from the Students

- Go through all the materials provided in weekly goals.md file. Though not graded, plan on having all goals completed prior to next module. Get to know github, the materials and tools well. Click on all links and find out, what you can learn from them.

## Program Completion

Graded components:

- Attendance/Participation/Weekly Projects
- Assessment #1
- Assessment #2
- Tech Interview
- Final Assessment

Certificates are contingent on passing the bootcamp based on overall grade (see graphic below)

<img src="./assets/welcome6.png" width="80%">

## Attendance

  1. What if I miss or cannot take part in a graded component?

     - Come up with an alternative date to complete and discuss with an instructor.
     - Follow up is your responsibility.
     - If you miss due to being sick or other obligations, please make alternative arrangements to complete. If you do not complete a graded component, you will not receive credit for that component of grading.

  1. What is expected of me in terms of classroom structure?

     - Students must have their cameras on at all times.
     - Participation is required. Students will be called upon to answer questions and/or solve problems

## Google - Our new best friend

As a developer understanding HOW to find the answers is key. The challenge is asking the right questions in web search. Be patient. This comes with time and practice.

    "I haven't failed, I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."
                                                    -- Thomas Edison

Please review the reading [Hacking Google](#hacking_google) for more details.

## GitHub - Push frequently

You will learn how to use git and Github over time. This will be a step by step process. Soon we will learn to push our code to Github.

We cannot help you if you have not pushed your code. This would be the equivalent of you asking for feedback on your novel but you have not even sent it to us.

## Visual Studio Code (VSC)

Our preferred IDE (integrated development environment).

VSC can be used with most programming languages so it's a great all-purpose IDE.
You are about to sit in front of the computer way more than you ever did. So how do you make your life easier and more enjoyable with VSC? We will discuss more in class but please install extensions discussed in the [Digital Literacy](#digital) reading.

## File Structure

Eventually, we will be using git and GitHub on a regular basis. Until then, please have the following set up on your desktop:

- bootcamp (folder, all lower case)
  - html (folder)
  - css (folder)
  - js (folder)

This will make your life so much better once we show you how to push and pull code from GitHub.

## Pushing Work

- At the end of each class Students will be asked to push their code to GitHub.
- A demo of this will come from the Instructor and then each subsequent class a random student will demo for the rest of the class.
- After this cycle has completed once, pushed code will be monitored by Instructors / Mentors to ensure students stay on track.

## This is YOUR bootcamp

You have the power to:

- Affect it
- Change it
- Add to it
- Improve it

So, please take weekly assigned work seriously. For changes, overlooked items, and issues, please reach out to us immediately. 

**Building a great reputation for this program benefits all of us.**

## Closing Thoughts

This is a journey. As we travel together these next 6-plus months, this is the time to be open-minded to new ideas and enjoy the ride.

Sometimes it will be bumpy, sometimes it will be slow and uphill. Other times it will be a downward dash.

But if you are intrigued, inspired, excited, and even a little scared, YOU are in the right place.

Welcome to the next chapter in your career journey!
